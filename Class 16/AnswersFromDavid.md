1. To repeat a block of code for a set amount of times ~~,or infinitely if you're bored and would like to watch your browser load forever~~.
  * For Loop:
      for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        window.print("https://goo.gl/bqTrZq")
      }

  * While Loop:
      var i = 0;
      while(true) {
        if(i === 10) {
          break;
        }
        window.print("https://goo.gl/bqTrZq")
        i++
      }
2. Run it in your browser console, or in Node.js in your terminal
3. An array is an ordered collection of elements. An ordered election of elements ~~is an array~~ is a collection of elements that is indexed in an ascending fashion starting at 0.
4. Array:
    var team = ["Charise", "David"];
    team.forEach(function(name){
      console.log(`Hi, I am ${name}`)
      })
5. The difference between a loop and an array is that a loop is a statement used for executing a block of code a certain amount of times, whereas an array is made to store a list of primitive data types. I also think loops and arrays are different types, because aside from the variables declared inside it, a for loop stores no data.
I would use a loop to loop over an array and have the elements do something, like print to the console or use them in a string interpolation or whatever.
6. Created a function with 2 parameters. Then return those 2 parameters and after the function added two values to it.
7. With console.log(arguments)
8. A scope is a set of variables, object and or functions you have access to. Scopes can be global or local.
9. Place A = Rembert: yes, codaisseur: no
   Place B = Rembert: yes codaisseur: yes
   Place C = Rembert: no, codaisseur: yes
   Place D = Rembert: no,  codaisseur: yes
10. I would use an object to store more multidimensional data than would be needed in an array. For example, if I was modelling something for a database or trying to mimic a Class. Or even making a very simple local db for testing.
11.
12. See Figure 1 Below :)
| property-name | value |
| ----|------|-------|
| firstName | 'Mimi' |
| favoriteLanguage | 'Javascript'|
| usefull| `function()` {
console.log('Something usefull is happening!!!')
} |
13. To work together in a group at the same time on a project. Even if you're not in the same room! Git is also used for version control.
14. Git add adds files to be committed to your local git repo(private to you), git commit commits the files to your local git repo and git push pushes your commits from your local repo onto the repo on the internet(public on github).
